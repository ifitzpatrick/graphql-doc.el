;; GraphQL Documentation explorer
;;
;; Opens a buffer with clickable graphql documentation for queries and mutations
;; generated from a graphql introspection query.  Use `graphql-doc` to start with
;; a registered graphql api endpoint.  Use `graphql-doc-open-url` to start with
;; an endpoint url.  Use `graphql-doc-add-api` to register an api endpoint.
